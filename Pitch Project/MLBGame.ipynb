    "# Predicting the Next Pitch Type\n",
    "Using the **mlbgame** library, we can build a training set of pitch sequences. Then, we will use that to train a Sequence to Sequence neural network to predict the next pitch given the previous pitches in an at bat. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, the predictions will be on an 'At Bat' basis.  That is, if you know the current set of pitches during an individual at bat, you will, hopefully, use this to predict the next one.  This simplifies the data collection, as the MLB game data is already split by at-bats. \n",
